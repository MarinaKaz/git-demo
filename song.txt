You and I just have a dream
To find our love a place
You and I were just made
To love each other now, forever and a day


Time stands still, when the days of innocence
Are falling for the night
I love you girl I always will
I swear I'm there for you
Till the day I die, yeah

You and I just have a dream
To find our love a place, where we can hide away
You and I were just made
To love each other now, forever and a day
